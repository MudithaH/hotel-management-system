# Quick Fix Summary - Railway Deployment

## The Problem
Railway was detecting your project as a Python application because of `requirements.txt` in the root directory, causing build failures.

## What We Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Renamed requirements.txt
- **Old**: `requirements.txt` (confused Railway into thinking it's Python)
- **New**: `PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` (now clearly a documentation file)

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Procfile
Created `Procfile` with the start command:
```
web: node src/server.js
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated railway.toml
Fixed the Dockerfile path and start command to work from the backend directory.

### 4. ‚úÖ Updated nixpacks.toml
Properly configured for Node.js 18 with correct start command.

### 5. ‚úÖ Updated .railwayignore
Added more files to ignore during deployment.

## Next Steps in Railway Dashboard

### üîß CRITICAL: Set Root Directory
1. Go to your Railway service
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Build**
3. Set **Root Directory** to: `backend`
4. Set **Builder** to: `NIXPACKS` (recommended) or leave as auto-detect
5. Click **Save**

**Important:** The `railway.toml` is now configured to use NIXPACKS builder which works better when Root Directory is set.

### üîß Set Environment Variables
Go to **Variables** tab and add:
```
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=hotel_management
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
JWT_SECRET=your-long-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### üöÄ Deploy
1. Click **Deploy** button or trigger redeploy
2. Watch the build logs
3. Should now successfully build and start!

## If Still Getting Errors

### Option 1: Manual Start Command
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Deploy
2. Set **Start Command** to: `node src/server.js`
3. Redeploy

### Option 2: Use Different Builder (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Build
2. Set **Root Directory** to `backend`
3. Set **Builder** to `NIXPACKS` (or leave as auto-detect)
4. Redeploy

**Why NIXPACKS?** It automatically detects Node.js projects and builds them without needing a Dockerfile in the root.

## Testing Deployment
Once deployed, test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}`

## Common Railway Settings Summary

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Root Directory | `backend` ‚ö†Ô∏è **MUST SET THIS** |
| Builder | `NIXPACKS` (recommended) |
| Start Command | `node src/server.js` (auto-detected) |
| Health Check Path | `/api/health` |
| Port | `5000` (Railway auto-assigns PORT env var) |
